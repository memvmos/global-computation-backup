Global Computation Backup (GCB)
A Symbolic Logic Ledger for Universal Computation State

About This Project

The Global Computation Backup (GCB) is a symbolic-arithmetic logic system designed to capture, encode, and restore computation itself — not just its outputs.

Powered by Matrix [0211] Dual-Delta Logic, GCB records both arithmetic results and symbolic transformations, creating a universal ledger of computational logic.

Why GCB?

🧩 Backup not just data, but logic and operations

🔗 Provide a symbolic ledger for computation identity and state

⚡ Compress logic patterns into delta sequences

🌐 Bridge between symbolic systems, codebases, and protocols

Technical Overview

GCB operates on two core delta functions:


aₙ₊₁ = aₙ ± 2  
bₙ₊₁ = bₙ ± 11  

Where:

a = Arithmetic State

b = Symbolic State

Each computation cycle yields dual outputs — a deterministic arithmetic result and a symbolic transformation — forming a recursive symbolic logic ledger.

Applications

✅ Blockchain Augmentation & Layer 0/1 Logic Sync

✅ AI Computation Backup and Explainability

✅ Cross-Platform Logic Translation

✅ Web3 Symbolic Smart Contracts & Identity State
